# Operation of Health Sector DApp

The DApp (Decentralized Application) created for the health sector focuses on the collection of personal data. These data are accessible to all those who possess the Token associated with each user.

## Key Features

- **Target Sector:** Health
- **Primary Functionality:** Collection of Personal Data

## Operational Details

The DApp operates based on the following principles:

1. **User Token:**
   - Each user of the DApp has a unique Token associated with their identity.

2. **Data Collection:**
   - The application allows for the collection of personal data from users in the health sector.

3. **Data Visibility:**
   - The collected data is visible to all those who possess the Token corresponding to the user.

## Advantages

- **Decentralization:** Being built on blockchain technology, the DApp leverages decentralization principles to ensure the security and integrity of data.

- **Controlled Access:** Data access is controlled through the possession of Tokens, providing an additional layer of security and privacy.

## Ethical and Legal Considerations

It is important to note that the collection and visibility of personal data must comply with ethical and legal standards established in the health sector. Special attention should be paid to user information privacy and confidentiality.

This is a basic outline of the operation of the DApp in the health sector. Any specific implementation should take into account the regulations and specific requirements of the corresponding jurisdiction.
